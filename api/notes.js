// queries in js, ie they help in routing .
// in the project, we need queries to fetch all the post, or posts according to categories or user.
// to use queries, we just have to write const var name for a particular query.
// eg. const username = req.query.user // ie the endpoint of API is given as  /?user= value, and username holds the value of this query in the endpoint.
